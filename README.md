# ambari-cassandra-service
Ambari service for installing and managing Cassandra on HDP clusters. Apache Cassandra is an open source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

#### Setup
- Download HDP 2.3 sandbox VM image (Sandbox_HDP_2.3_1_VMware.ova) from [Hortonworks website](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/)
- Import Sandbox_HDP_2.3_1_VMware.ova into VMWare and set the VM memory size to 8GB
- Now start the VM
- After it boots up, find the IP address of the VM and add an entry into your machines hosts file. For example:
```
xx.xx.xx.xx sandbox.hortonworks.com sandbox    
```
  - Note that you will need to replace the above xx.xx.xx.xx with the IP for your own VM
  
- Connect to the VM via SSH (password hadoop)
```
ssh root@sandbox.hortonworks.com
```

- To download the Cassandra service folder, run below
```
VERSION=`hdp-select status hadoop-client | sed 's/hadoop-client - \([0-9]\.[0-9]\).*/\1/'`
sudo git clone https://github.com/ajak6/ambari-cassandra-service.git   /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/stacks/HDP/$VERSION/services/CASSANDRA   
```
- Restart Ambari
```
#sandbox
service ambari restart

#non sandbox
sudo service ambari-server restart
```
```
- Then you can click on 'Add Service' from the 'Actions' dropdown menu in the bottom left of the Ambari dashboard:

On bottom left -> Actions -> Add service -> check Cassandra -> Next -> check nodes to be present in the cluster and act as client-> Next -> Change any config you like (e.g. install dir, memory sizes, num containers or values in cassandra.yaml) -> Next -> Deploy


- On successful deployment you will see the Flink service as part of Ambari stack and will be able to start/stop the service from here:

- You can see the parameters you configured under 'Configs' tab

#### Remove service

- To remove the Cassandra service: 
  - Stop the service via Ambari
  - Unregister the service

  ```
export SERVICE=Cassandra
export PASSWORD=admin
export AMBARI_HOST=localhost
#detect name of cluster
output=`curl -u admin:$PASSWORD -i -H 'X-Requested-By: ambari'  http://$AMBARI_HOST:8080/api/v1/clusters`
CLUSTER=`echo $output | sed -n 's/.*"cluster_name" : "\([^\"]*\)".*/\1/p'`

curl -u admin:$PASSWORD -i -H 'X-Requested-By: ambari' -X DELETE http://$AMBARI_HOST:8080/api/v1/clusters/$CLUSTER/services/$SERVICE

#if above errors out, run below first to fully stop the service
#curl -u admin:$PASSWORD -i -H 'X-Requested-By: ambari' -X PUT -d '{"RequestInfo": {"context" :"Stop $SERVICE via REST"}, "Body": {"ServiceInfo": {"state": "INSTALLED"}}}' http://$AMBARI_HOST:8080/api/v1/clusters/$CLUSTER/services/$SERVICE
  ```
  - Remove artifacts
  ```
  rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
  
  ```
